    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

    <p>SnapChef ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application and website.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and display name through Google Sign-In or email/password authentication via Firebase Authentication.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you use the app, including recipes generated, food analyses performed, and feature interactions. This data is stored locally on your device.</p>
    <p><strong>Camera & Photos:</strong> When you use the camera or upload photos for ingredient scanning or food analysis, these images are processed by our AI service (OpenAI) to generate recipes or nutritional information. Images are sent to the AI service for processing only and are not permanently stored on our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Health Data:</strong> Health goals, water tracking, and meal logging data you enter is stored locally on your device using browser localStorage.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide AI-powered recipe generation and food analysis</li>
        <li>To manage your account and authenticate your identity</li>
        <li>To track your usage limits (free tier vs. premium)</li>
        <li>To save your preferences, favorites, and meal plans locally</li>
        <li>To send notifications you have opted into (water reminders, meal reminders)</li>
        <li>To improve our services and user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Most of your data (recipes, favorites, meal plans, health data, shopping lists) is stored locally on your device using browser localStorage. This data is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Cloud Services:</strong> We use Firebase (Google) for authentication and Netlify for hosting. Your account credentials are managed securely by Firebase Authentication.</p>
    <p><strong>AI Processing:</strong> When you generate recipes or analyze food, your text prompts and images are sent to OpenAI's API for processing. Please refer to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for their data handling practices.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We share data only with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> For authentication services</li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> For AI recipe generation and food analysis (text and image data)</li>
        <li><strong>Netlify:</strong> For hosting our application</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. All data transmission is encrypted via HTTPS. Authentication is handled by Firebase's secure infrastructure. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your personal data stored in the app</li>

        <li>Opt out of notifications at any time</li>
        <li>Request information about what data we hold</li>
    </ul>
